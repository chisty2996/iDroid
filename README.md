# Abstract

The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. Apple Inc. has a cloud storage and cloud computing service for iPhone called iCloud. Whenever we turn on an iPhone, the user must provide his iCloud id and password. Security of iCloud is the highest. The password must contain at least one capital letter, one small letter, one numeric digit and the length must be at least 9. Because of this complexity with the password, sometimes users forget their password. The password of iCloud is not easily recoverable. The only way to recover this password is to contact and take help from Apple Office directly.
	As we don’t have any Apple Offices in our country, in case an iPhone user ever loses his password, his/her iPhone becomes uninteractable. Most of the cases, the password is not recovered and the phone is thought as useless. Instead of throwing it away, user can do something meaningful with it which might make the iPhone valuable. That is what we are trying do in our app.


# INTRO

iDroid is iOS platform based app that tries to help people with iCloud locked iPhone to do something good with it. If any iPhone user doesn’t want to go through all the trouble and unlock their iCloud locked iPhone, we give them the opportunity to sell their phone’s parts. There can be some iPhone users who are having problem with their smartphone parts e.g. display, speaker, battery etc. Also, whenever the battery health of an iPhone goes below 75%, Apple recommends to change it. These users have to replace the parts. Though thus can be done so in any mobile accessories market, there’s only a few of them. iPhone users cannot go to those market just from anywhere. Besides, no online selling app covers smartphone parts dedicatedly. iDroid tries to solve this problem.

# Purpose

The iCloud locked iPhone still has parts that is good and can be used with another iPhone. The sole purpose of iDroid is to sell those parts to another iPhone user who is facing problem with one or more parts of the phone. iDroid lets the first user sell those parts and get some money in return instead of nothing. And also, the user who just needs a part can buy that part instead of replacing the smartphone. iDroid will work as a platform between these two types of users. Not only for iPhone, iDroid does the same for other smartphones.

# Objectives

1. To make a platform between smartphone users
2. To sell various parts of iCloud locked iPhones
3. To also sell parts of general smartphones
4. To make the communication between seller and buyer
5. To make smartphone parts more available
6. To make the app for IOS users

# Future Scope

	1. As currently there’s no online selling app in the market that is dedicated to smartphone parts, this app has huge opportunity to make an impact.
	2. Where most of the app developers tend to make app on android platform, this app is developed on iOS platform so that iOS users can use this app as their advantage.
	3. There can be a cart system for buyer to enlist the items he wants to buy or if he wants to keep track of some items.
	4. There will be a direct messaging system through the app so that the buyer can chat with the seller and negotiate.
